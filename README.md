#CheckDivisibility

A simple Java console application that prints numbers from 1 to 20. The application checks each number for divisibility by 3 and 5 and prints:

"A" if the number is divisible by 3.
"B" if the number is divisible by 5.
"C" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
The number itself if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.
